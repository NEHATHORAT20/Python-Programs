#Write a program which contains filter(), map() and reduce() in it. 
#Python application which contains one list of numbers.
#List contains the numbers which are accepted from user. 
#Filter should filter out all such numbers which greater than or equal to 70 and less than or equal to 90. 
#Map function will increase each number by 10. Reduce will return product of all that numbers.
#Input List = [4, 34, 36, 76, 68, 24, 89, 23, 86, 90, 45, 70]
#List after filter = [76, 89, 86, 90, 70]
#List after map = [86, 99, 96, 100, 80]
#Output of reduce = 6538752000
